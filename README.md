### LevelSetsPy Library

This repo implements basic level set methods. It started as a reimplementation if Ian Mitchell's level set toolbox,but has since metamorphorsed into a standalone project of its own. It was a project started by Lekan Molu in August, 2021.

#### Features

- Linear input/output systems in state-space and frequency domain
- Block diagram algebra: serial, parallel, and feedback interconnections
- Time response: initial, step, impulse
- Frequency response: Bode and Nyquist plots
- Control analysis: stability, reachability, observability, stability margins
- Control design: eigenvalue placement, linear quadratic regulator
- Estimator design: linear quadratic estimator (Kalman filter)



### Status

 [x] Testing.


### TODO's

- [+] Fix len of smooth in derivL computation in upwindFirstWENO5.py

- [ ] Tensor operators in PODS Function.
  - Todo Fall 2022.
