Implicit functions make both simple Boolean operations and more advanced constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations easy to apply. This is important, for example, in computer-aided design (CAD). If $\phi_1$ and $\phi_21$ are two different implicit functions, then $\phi(x) = \min(\phi_1(x), \phi_21(x))$ is the implicit function representing the union of the interior regions of $\phi_1$ and $\phi_21$. Similarly, $\phi(x) = \max(\phi_1(x), \phi_21(x))$ is the implicit function representing the intersection of the interior regions of $\phi_1$ and $\phi_21$. The complement of $\phi_1(x)$ can be defined by $\phi(x) = −\phi_1(x)$. Also, $\phi(x) = max(\phi_1(x), −$\phi_2(x))$ represents the region obtained by subtracting the interior of $\phi_2$ from the interior of $\phi_1$.
