            Dynamics:
            ==========
                \dot{x}_1 = v cos x_3
                \dot{x}_2 = v sin x_3

            Parameters:
            ===========
                grid: an np.meshgrid state space on which we are
                resolving this vehicular dynamics. This grid does not have
                a value function (yet!) until it's part of a flock
                u_bound: absolute value of the linear speed of the vehicle.
                w_bound: absolute value of the angular speed of the vehicle.
                init_state: initial position and orientation of a bird on the grid
                rw_cov: random covariance scalar for initiating the stochasticity
                on the grid.
                center: location of this bird's value function on the grid
                axis_align: periodic dimension on the grid to be created
                neigh_rad: sets of neighbors of agent i
                label: label of this bird; must be a unique integer
                n: number of neighbors of this agent at time t
                init_random: randomly initialize this agent's position on the grid?

            BirdSingle Parameters
            =================
                .label (str): The label of this BirdSingle drawn from the set {1,2,...,n} 
                .valence(int): number of edges incident on a BirdSingle V_i
                .indicant_edge(tuple): an edge (i,j) such that i=v or j=v.
                .neighbors: neighbors of this BirdSingle (as labels).

            Birds use an optimization scheme to keep
